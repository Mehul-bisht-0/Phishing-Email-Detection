# **📧 Phishing Email Detection using Machine Learning & NLP**

A complete machine learning project for detecting phishing emails using TF-IDF vectors, NLP preprocessing, and multiple classification algorithms.
This repository also includes a Flask-based web application that allows users to paste email text and instantly receive a phishing/legitimate prediction.

## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to identify phishing emails using machine learning techniques.
It uses:

**TF-IDF** for text vectorization

**NLP** preprocessing for cleaning and transforming text

Multiple ML **Classification models** for comparing performance

A simple and intuitive Flask web app for real-time predictions

## ✨ Features

✔️ Email text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)

✔️ TF-IDF vectorizer for converting text to numerical features

✔️ Multiple ML models trained and compared

✔️ Pre-trained model + vectorizer saved for deployment

✔️ Flask interface for easy user interaction

✔️ Evaluation metrics and visualizations
