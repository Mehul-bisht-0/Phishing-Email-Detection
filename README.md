📧 Phishing Email Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

A machine learning–powered system for detecting phishing emails, built using TF-IDF vectors, NLP preprocessing, and multiple classification algorithms. The project includes a lightweight, user-friendly Flask web application that allows users to input email text and receive instant predictions.

🚀 Features

TF-IDF Vectorization for converting email text into numerical features

NLP Pipeline with tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization

Multiple ML Classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.)

Model Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Flask Web App for real-time phishing detection

Clean and modular Python code structure

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

The project experiments with several ML models to compare performance:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SGD Classifier
MLP Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Decision Trees
XGBoost

Each model is trained on TF-IDF features extracted from processed email text.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

scikit-learn

NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)

Flask (backend & web interface)

Pandas / NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for evaluation plots)
